# keep-github-actions-alive-min-dependencies

GitHub action to keep Github-Actions alive but with minimal dependencies.

This GitHub Action is inspired by https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/keepalive-workflow.

## Why

GitHub will stop running your actions after 60 days of no commit activity in your repository.
After that your cron based jobs wil stop to run.

This Action helps you to avoid that :-)

## How is this accomplished

It will run as a scheduled job and if the current repository is close to the 60 day limit (or whatever time limit you specify)
the action will add an empty commit to the git repository.

## How to use

1. Go to repository settings, Click on Actions > General. Update the "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions". Click on save.
